# Snapchat Dynamic Scheduling 
*Predicting Snapchat episode performance through a Neural Network*

## Purpose 
*This is a replication of a real-world analysis, edited for the suitability of a github repo*

Through previous analysis, it has been discovered that episodes on a social media platform (such as Snapchat) have their performance thwarted with the following episode's release on channel - with this, scheduling content to reflect performance rather than a weekly set schedule becomes an area of interest, i.e dynamically scheduling episodes to give longer running time to high performers, and cutting off time on platform for low performers.  

Predicting the future performance of an episode at incremental periods is valuable in that it can inform schedule decision making  when compared against benchmarks on channel. The purpose of this dashboard & tool is to help expedite a data-informed process that may otherwise require rigorous daily analysis.
